# Wireshark Traffic Analysis Lab

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on packet analysis using Wireshark in a controlled lab environment. The goal is to analyze common network protocols from a SOC analyst perspective.

## 🧪 Lab Environment
- Kali Linux (Traffic Capture & Analysis)
- Lubuntu Linux (Client / Traffic Generation)
- Tools: Wireshark, curl, ping, ssh

## 🔍 Traffic Analyzed
- DNS – Domain name resolution analysis
- HTTP – Cleartext web traffic inspection
- ARP – IP-to-MAC resolution and MITM relevance
- ICMP – Ping and network reconnaissance
- SSH – Encrypted traffic analysis
- TCP – SYN and connection behavior analysis

## 🛡️ SOC Relevance
- Identify suspicious DNS activity
- Detect cleartext vs encrypted protocols
- Understand ARP-based MITM attacks
- Analyze TCP flags for scanning and DoS behavior
- Investigate encrypted traffic patterns

## 📂 Artifacts Included
- PCAP files for each protocol
- Screenshots highlighting key packets
- Wireshark display filters

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Packet analysis
- Network troubleshooting
- SOC Tier 1 traffic investigation
- CEH Sniffing & MITM concepts
